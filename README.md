**ESTIMATING FLIGHT DELAYS USING MACHINE LEARNED CLASSIFIERS AND ERROR CALCULATION**
Flight delays around the world have become a major problem for the aviation industry. Because of the aviation industry's rapid growth over the past 20 years, air traffic congestion has resulted in flight delays. Flight delays not only hurt the economy but also raise fuel emissions and consumption, both of which have an adverse effect on the environment. As a result, every safety measure required must be done to prevent flight delays and cancellations. This article's primary goal is to estimate flight duration by utilizing a variety of variables. With an emphasis on the future, it currently uses a variety of prediction techniques, including logistic regression, decision tree regression, Bayesian ridge, random forest regression, and gradient boost regression in Python 3 to build models that forecast future usage delays. We will make it easy for people to estimate that the plane will arrive on time by monitoring it or utilizing past data. Expanded inspection will also aid in the aviation industry's loss reduction.
